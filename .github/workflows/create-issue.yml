          ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-compliant resources after remediation

          **Source Workflow:** [${{ inputs.workflow_run_id }}](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ inputs.workflow_run_id }})  

          ### Resources by EPaC environment 

          The following environments have non-compliant resources after remediation:

          ${{ steps.extract-compliance.outputs.compliance-data }}

          ### üìã Next Steps

          1. **Review each environment** listed above for non-compliant resources
          2. **Check environment-specific issues:**
             - Verify policy assignments are correctly configured for each environment
             - Check if resources require manual remediation
             - Review environment-specific exclusions or exemptions
          3. **Consider environment-specific actions:**
             - Update resource configurations to meet policy requirements
             - Apply policy exemptions if business-justified
             - Verify policy definitions work correctly across all environments
          4. **Monitor compliance status** after making changes

          ### üîç Environment-Specific Guidance

          - **epac-dev**: Development environment compliance issues may indicate policy testing needs
          - **tenant**: Production tenant issues require immediate attention and careful remediation
