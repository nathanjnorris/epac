# You can trigger an assessment of policy compliance before and after remediation by editing this file. 
# Provide the Resource Id of one or more resources, resource groups or subscriptions to be included (or ignored) in the of assessment. 
# For example, if you wanted to check your policy compliance in a few scopes of `epac-dev` only, you could set this file to: 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# epac-dev:
#   scopes: |
#     /subscriptions/yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy
#     /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/QA/
#   scopes-ignore: /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/QA/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/demoApp
# epac-prod: 
#   scopes:
#   scopes-ignore: 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If there are any non-compliant resources after remediation, a CSV report on the compliance state of the scanned scope will be generated.
# It will be available within each EPAC Remediation workflow run:
# https://github.com/reecegroup/azure-enterprise-policy/actions/workflows/epac-remediation-workflow.yml
